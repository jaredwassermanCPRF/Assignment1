1) A compiler

2) Error A is a compliation error because the error occurs when the program is being complied and is due to a syntax error (leaving out the ;). Error B is also a compliation, in this case due to putting a number at the begging of a variable name. Error C is a run time error because the is nothing wrong with the syntax but the task is can not be done (the computer is not able to divide by 0.0).

3) There are three errors with this code. First %d is used when %f has to be used because x is a float not a int. Another issue is that Return is written with a capital R when the method is named with a lowercase r. The last issue is that void is written infront of main() when int should be.

1) A compiler turns the code written in C (or other high level languages) into Assembly code (which is then translated by Assembler into machine code) so it can be executed.
