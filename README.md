# Assignment 1

## Objectives
Get comfortable with simple output, variables, and data types by practicing them in a simple program.
Learn how to submit assignments on GitHub.

### Part 1
Write a program `initials.c` to print your initials formed by rows of pound signs. For instance:
```
      ###         ###     ###
      ###         ###     ###
      ###         ###     ###
      ###         ###########
      ###         ###     ###
      ###         ###     ###
      #########   ###     ###
```

### Part 2
In a text file `assignment1.txt`, answer the following questions:

1.  What is a compiler? Explain thoroughly and in your own words. 

2.  Are the following errors compile time errors or runtime errors? Explain the difference. 

    a.
    ```
      int x = 2
    ```
    b.
    ```
      float 1num = 3.0;
    ```
    c. 
    ```
      double num  = 4.0 / 0.0;
    ```
3. What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

   ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    void main() {  
        float x = 41.5;  
        printf("The value of x is %f", x);
        Return 0;
    }  
    ```
